# Cyclistic-bike-share
This is a capstone from Google Data Analytics Certificate, a case study on Bike share. Cyclistic is a fictive company
Introduction

This capstone project from the Google Data Analytics Certificate focuses on the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, I work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, along with some key team members. In order to answer the business questions, I am going to follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.

I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From the insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
